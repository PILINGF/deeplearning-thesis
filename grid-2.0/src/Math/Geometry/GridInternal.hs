class Eq x ⇒ Grid g s x | g → s, g → x where
  -- | Returns the indices of all tiles in a grid.
  indices ∷ g → [x]
  -- | @'distance' a b@ returns the minimum number of moves required to get
  --   from @a@ to @b@, moving between adjacent tiles at each step. (Two tiles
  --   are adjacent if they share an edge.) If @a@ or @b@ are not contained
  --   within @g@, the result is undefined.
  distance ∷ x → x → g → Int
  -- | Returns the dimensions of the grid. 
  --   For example, if @g@ is a 4x3 rectangular grid, @'size' g@ would return 
  --   @(4, 3)@, while @'tileCount' g@ would return @12@.
  size ∷ g → s
  -- | @'neighbours' x g@ returns the indices of the tiles in the grid @g@
  --   which are adjacent to the tile at @x@.
  neighbours ∷ x → g → [x]
  neighbours x g = filter (\a -> distance x a g ≡ 1 ) $ indices g
  -- | @x `'inGrid'` g@ returns true if the index @x@ is contained within @g@,
  --   otherwise it returns false.

  -- | @'viewpoint' x g@ returns a list of pairs associating the index of each
  --   tile in @g@ with its distance to the tile with index @x@. If @x@ is not
  --   contained within @g@, the result is undefined.

  --   otherwise.
  empty ∷ g → Bool

  -- | Returns @False@ if the number of tiles in a grid is zero, @True@ 
  --   otherwise.
